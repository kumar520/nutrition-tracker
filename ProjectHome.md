Nutrition Tracker is a comprehensive meal tracking system. It's current feature set includes, but is not limited to:

1) Adding foods to the database simply by reading the nutrition facts label;
2) User registration and sign-on;
3) Adding meals for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks;
4) Viewing your total caloric, fat, and fiber;
5) A notes section to jot down how you felt or what exercising you accomplished on a particular day.

Upcoming features:

1) View a dump of meals and notes entered into the site;
2) Meal graphs to highlight changes in diet over time;
3) More carb and protein statistics on the My Tracker pages;
4) Summary view of all meals for a particular day (this is how NT worked in its first release so this is an easy one!)

Built on PHP and MySQL, Nutrition Tracker can be installed on nearly any platform or environment. The application uses many open source, yet well-adopted, tools like Smarty, jQuery (validation and Ajax), Yahoo UI (for CSS), and ADODB5. These tools make site updates and customizations a snap!

The next update will be a more carb-centric in that it will show more stats related to the amount of carbs the user is taking in. There will also be a section for glycemic indexes. That's still in conceptual phase.
